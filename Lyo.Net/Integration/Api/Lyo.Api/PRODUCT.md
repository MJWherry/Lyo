</p>

---

**Lyo** is a production-ready API framework for .NET that gives you 17 fully-featured endpoints from a single builder call. Dynamic queries, **SQL-aware field projection** (`QueryProject`), full CRUD, bulk operations, caching,
auth, and observability — all wired together, all out of the box.

```csharp
app.CreateBuilder<AppDbContext, PersonEntity, PersonRequest, PersonResponse>("person")
    .WithCrud(ApiFeatureFlag.All)
    .RequireAuthorization("AdminPolicy")
    .Build();
```

That's it. You now have a complete REST API with filtering, sorting, projections, subqueries, pagination, CRUD, bulk operations, export, caching, and OpenTelemetry — for any EF
Core entity.

---

## The Problem

Every .NET team builds the same infrastructure over and over:

- Filtering, sorting, and pagination logic
- CRUD endpoints with validation and error handling
- Bulk operations that don't lose the entire batch on one failure
- Caching that actually invalidates when data changes
- Per-endpoint authorization
- Observability and structured logging

This takes **2–6 months** per service. Then you maintain it forever. Then you do it again for the next service.

**Lyo eliminates all of it.**

## What You Get

### Dynamic Query Engine

A structured JSON query language with the expressiveness of GraphQL and the simplicity of REST.

```json
{
  "Start": 0,
  "Amount": 100,
  "QueryNode": {
    "Condition": "And",
    "Children": [
      { "Property": "IsActive", "Comparator": "Equals", "Value": "true" },
      { "Property": "FirstName", "Comparator": "NotEquals", "Value": null },
      {
        "Condition": "Or",
        "Children": [
          { "Property": "LastName", "Comparator": "Regex", "Value": "^[A-Z]" },
          { "Property": "Source", "Comparator": "In", "Value": "A,B,C,D,E,F" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "SubQuery": {
          "Condition": "And",
          "Children": [
            { "Property": "DateOfBirth", "Comparator": "GreaterThan", "Value": "1990-01-01" }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "Include": [
    "contactaddresses.address",
    "contactphonenumbers.phonenumber",
    "contactemailaddresses.emailaddress"
  ],
  "Select": ["Id", "FirstName", "LastName", "contactaddresses.address.city"],
  "SortBy": [
    { "Property": "LastName", "Direction": "Asc" },
    { "Property": "FirstName", "Direction": "Asc" }
  ]
}
```

**Features:**

- Nested logical trees (And/Or) with unlimited depth
- Subquery support with SQL-first pushdown — no in-memory materialization
- 10+ comparators: Equals, NotEquals, Contains, In, GreaterThan, LessThan, Regex, and more
- Multi-hop navigation includes (`contactaddresses.address` traverses two tables)
- GraphQL-style field projection with nested path support
- Multi-sort with direction control
- Works on **any `IQueryable<T>`** — not just EF Core

### Query projection (`QueryProject`)

A first-class **`POST …/QueryProject`** endpoint for **sparse, nested projections** — not just trimming JSON after a full entity load.

- **Declarative `Select`** — list the fields you need, including **multi-hop paths** (e.g. `contactaddresses.address.city`) and collection branches; optional **computed fields** for server-side expressions.
- **SQL-level projection when possible** — the engine pushes eligible shapes to the database so you move **less data** and avoid hydrating full entity graphs when the query allows it; more complex shapes fall back to **load-then-project** with the same request model.
- **Same power as `Query`** — shared filters, `Include` / `MatchedOnly`, sorts, paging, subqueries, and **query result caching** (including optional UTF-8 payload + compression).
- **Client-friendly JSON** — projected rows can include **`entityTypes`** (and related metadata) so consumers know the shape of each column.

Use **`Query`** when you want full entities (or maximum flexibility with includes); use **`QueryProject`** when grids, APIs, or integrations need **narrow columns and smaller payloads** by design.

### 17 Endpoints from One Builder

| Operation                 | Method | Endpoint        |
|---------------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Query                     | POST   | `/Query`        |
| Projected query           | POST   | `/QueryProject` |
| Get by ID                 | GET    | `/{id}`         |
| Create                    | POST   | `/`             |
| Create Bulk               | POST   | `/Bulk`         |
| Update                    | POST   | `/Update`       |
| Update Bulk               | POST   | `/Bulk/Update`  |
| Patch (property-level)    | PATCH  | `/`             |
| Patch Bulk                | PATCH  | `/Bulk`         |
| Upsert                    | POST   | `/Upsert`       |
| Upsert Bulk               | POST   | `/Bulk/Upsert`  |
| Delete                    | DELETE | `/{id}`         |
| Delete (by body)          | DELETE | `/`             |
| Delete Bulk               | DELETE | `/Bulk`         |
| Export                    | POST   | `/Export`       |
| Query History             | POST   | `/QueryHistory` |
| Stored Procedures         | —      | Configurable    |

### Bulk Operations with Individual Fallback

Every bulk operation follows the same pattern:

1. Attempt the batch operation for maximum throughput
2. If any item fails, fall back to individual processing
3. Return a detailed result showing which succeeded and which failed

```json
{
  "createdCount": 498,
  "failedCount": 2,
  "results": [
    { "isSuccess": true, "data": { "id": "..." } },
    { "isSuccess": false, "error": { "message": "Duplicate key violation" } }
  ]
}
```

No more "one bad record kills the entire import." Partial success is the default.

### Property-Level Patch

Update individual fields without sending the full entity:

```json
{
  "Keys": ["550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"],
  "Properties": {
    "FirstName": "Jane",
    "IsActive": true
  },
  "AllowMultiple": false
}
```

### Export

Query your data and export it directly as CSV, XLSX, or JSON — with column mapping and formatting.

### Before/After Hooks

Inject custom logic at every stage of every operation:

```csharp
app.CreateBuilder<AppDbContext, PersonEntity, PersonRequest, PersonResponse>("person")
    .WithCreate(config => {
        config.Before = async (entity, ctx) => {
            entity.CreatedBy = ctx.User.Identity.Name;
            return entity;
        };
        config.After = async (entity, ctx) => {
            await notificationService.SendCreatedAlert(entity);
            return entity;
        };
    })
    .Build();
```

### Per-Endpoint Authorization

Granular auth control — at the builder level or per operation:

```csharp
app.CreateBuilder<AppDbContext, PersonEntity, PersonRequest, PersonResponse>("person")
    .RequireAuthorization("ReadPolicy")
    .WithCreate(config => config.Auth = EndpointAuth.RequireRole("Admin"))
    .WithDelete(config => config.Auth = EndpointAuth.RequireClaim("permission", "delete"))
    .WithQuery()
    .WithGet()
    .Build();
```

### Feature Flags

Only expose what you need:

```csharp
.WithCrud(ApiFeatureFlag.ReadOnly)      // Query + Get only
.WithCrud(ApiFeatureFlag.BasicCrud)     // Query, Get, Create, Update, Patch, Delete
.WithCrud(ApiFeatureFlag.FullCrud)      // BasicCrud + Upsert
.WithCrud(ApiFeatureFlag.All)           // Everything including bulk operations + export
```

### Caching with Automatic Invalidation

Built-in support for local caching or distributed caching via FusionCache:

- Query and QueryProject results are cached with tag-based keys derived from the request (see **`QueryCacheKeyBuilder`** in the library README).
- **Built-in write paths invalidate the query cache for that entity type** after a successful operation: **Create**, **Update**, **Patch** (including bulk patch where applicable), **Delete**, and **Upsert** (including bulk upsert), implemented via **`InvalidateQueryCacheAsync<TDbModel>()`** in the corresponding CRUD services.
- **Per–root-entity isolation across unrelated types** — **`InvalidateQueryCacheAsync<T>()`** clears every cached query tagged `entity:{T}` (lowercased type name). Patching **Person** clears cached **Person** queries; it does **not** clear an unrelated aggregate’s cache (e.g. **Order** vs **Person**).
- **Includes and related entity types** — for **`GET` with `includes`**, **`POST …/Query`** with **`Include`**, and **`POST …/QueryProject`** (SQL and fallback paths), cached entries are tagged for the root and for **each EF entity type** returned by **`GetReferencedTypes`** for the effective include paths (derived from includes or from projection / where). Patching a **child** (e.g. **Address**) calls **`InvalidateQueryCacheAsync<AddressEntity>()`**, which invalidates cached **parent** reads (e.g. **Person**) that referenced that type in the stored tags.

### OpenTelemetry and Observability

Every operation is instrumented:

- `api.crud.duration` — execution time per operation
- `api.crud.requests` / `api.crud.success` / `api.crud.failure` — counters
- `api.crud.result_count` — items returned
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Trace and span IDs in error responses

### Database Agnostic

Lyo works with any EF Core provider:

- PostgreSQL (Npgsql)
- SQL Server
- MySQL / MariaDB
- SQLite
- Oracle
- Cosmos DB

The only provider-specific feature is the `Regex` comparator, which uses PostgreSQL functions. All other features work identically across providers.

### Works Beyond EF Core

The query engine operates on `IQueryable<T>`, which means it works with:

- In-memory collections (`List<T>.AsQueryable()`)
- Custom `IQueryable` implementations
- Any data source that implements the interface
- Unit tests without a database

Use it in background jobs, data pipelines, report generation — anywhere you filter and page over collections.

## Performance

Benchmarked on a laptop (Intel Core Ultra 7 155U, 62 GB RAM) with API, PostgreSQL, and the load generator all running on the same machine. Latest archived k6 suite: **April 2026**
(`k6/framework-person/results/20260414-002619/`). See `K6_BENCHMARK_ANALYSIS.md` for full per-scenario tables, methodology, and caveats. Production deployments on dedicated infrastructure would perform better.

### Lightweight Queries (filters, sorts, projections, subqueries)

| Metric          | Result (April 2026 archive)     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| Scenario spread | **~8–21 ms** avg (spike → mixed) |
| p95 latency     | **~11–32 ms** (scenario-dependent) |
| p99 latency     | **~15–46 ms** (mixed load)      |
| Throughput      | 20–56 req/s sustained          |
| Success rate    | **100%**                        |

Select projection spike scenario averages **~8 ms**; mixed five-shape rotation **~21 ms** avg; subquery load **~16 ms** avg — on shared laptop hardware with cache-bypass style keys.

### Heavy Navigation Queries (3 tables, 100–300 rows, ~601 KB response)

| Metric          | Result (April 2026 archive)           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Average latency | **178 ms**                            |
| Median latency  | 144 ms                                |
| p95 latency     | 475 ms                                |
| Throughput      | **113** req/s under 40 concurrent VUs |
| Success rate    | **100%** (all within 2.5 s SLA)       |

Realistic workload: person → contact_addresses → address. **54K+** HTTP requests in the stress stage; averages are higher than a March 2026 archive run because API, Postgres, and k6 share CPU under load. The 7-table, ~2000-row stress case is more demanding; see `K6_BENCHMARK_ANALYSIS.md`.

### Sustained Load (2-hour soak test)

| Metric          | Result (April 2026 archive) |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Total requests  | **266,589**                 |
| Duration        | 2 hours (configured)        |
| Average latency | 118 ms                      |
| Success rate    | **100%** (all k6 checks)    |
| Errors          | **0**                       |

Zero HTTP failures over the soak window. Mixed query types with periodic heavy-include spikes; tail latency includes intentional heavy shapes — see `K6_BENCHMARK_ANALYSIS.md` for p95/p99.

### How This Compares

| Framework                          | Typical dynamic read p95 (industry ballpark) | Notes                                 |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Lyo** (archived k6)              | **~11–32 ms** lightweight scenarios         | Expression trees + EF Core + Postgres |
| Hasura / PostgREST                 | 5–30 ms                                     | No ORM — direct DB to JSON            |
| Typical EF Core API (hand-written) | 50–200 ms                                   | Manual filter/sort implementation     |
| Django REST Framework              | 50–300 ms                                   | Python ORM                            |
| Spring Boot + JPA                  | 30–150 ms                                   | Hibernate                             |
| Ruby on Rails                      | 80–400 ms                                   | ActiveRecord                          |

Lyo stays in the **same order of magnitude** as thin Postgres-to-JSON gateways for comparable read shapes on this hardware, while keeping full EF Core mapping, navigation fixup, and the dynamic query surface.

---

## Generic by Design

Lyo is built on five type parameters:

```
TDbContext    — your EF Core DbContext
TDbEntity     — your database entity
TRequest      — your request DTO
TResponse     — your response DTO
TKey          — your primary key type (Guid, int, long, string)
```

Define your entity, map your DTOs, call `Build()`. Lyo handles everything between the HTTP request and the database.

```csharp
// Services
builder.Services.AddLyoQueryServices();
builder.Services.AddLyoCrudServices<AppDbContext>();

// Endpoints
app.CreateBuilder<AppDbContext, OrderEntity, OrderRequest, OrderResponse, int>("orders", "Orders")
    .WithCrud(ApiFeatureFlag.FullCrud)
    .RequireAuthorization()
    .Build();

app.CreateBuilder<AppDbContext, ProductEntity, ProductRequest, ProductResponse>("products", "Products")
    .WithCrud(ApiFeatureFlag.ReadOnly)
    .AllowAnonymous()
    .Build();

app.CreateBuilder<AppDbContext, CustomerEntity, CustomerRequest, CustomerResponse>("customers", "Customers")
    .WithCrud(ApiFeatureFlag.All)
    .RequireAuthorization("AdminPolicy")
    .WithDelete(config => config.Auth = EndpointAuth.RequireRole("SuperAdmin"))
    .Build();
```

Three entities. Full APIs. Under 20 lines.

## Thread Safe

All services are designed for concurrent access. No external synchronization required. Proven under sustained concurrent load with zero race conditions or data corruption across
301K+ requests.

## FAQ

**Is this another OData?**
No. OData uses URL query strings with a flat syntax that breaks down for complex queries. Lyo uses structured JSON request bodies that support nested logical trees, subqueries, and
regex — things OData can't express. Lyo also provides full CRUD, bulk operations, export, and caching. OData provides none of those.

**Is this GraphQL?**
No. Lyo is REST-native. No schema definitions, no resolvers, no DataLoader pattern, no client-side libraries required. Any HTTP client that can POST JSON can use Lyo. You get
GraphQL-level query power without the GraphQL complexity.

**Do I need PostgreSQL?**
No. Lyo works with any EF Core provider. The only PostgreSQL-specific feature is the `Regex` comparator. All other features — filters, sorts, includes, subqueries, projections,
CRUD, bulk operations — work on any database.

**Can I add custom business logic?**
Yes. Every operation supports Before and After hooks that run in-process. You have full access to the entity, the HttpContext, and any injected services.

**What if I only need the query engine?**
The query engine works independently on any `IQueryable<T>`. Use it in services, background jobs, or data pipelines — no HTTP endpoints required.

**What about existing entities?**
Lyo works with your existing EF Core entities and DbContext. No base classes to inherit, no interfaces to implement, no attributes to add. Point it at your entity and build.

**Is it production-ready?**
Yes. Benchmarked under sustained load (301K requests, 2 hours, zero HTTP failures), with OpenTelemetry instrumentation, structured logging, and clean error responses with
trace/span
IDs.
